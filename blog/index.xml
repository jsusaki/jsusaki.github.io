      <description>Ralph Waldo Emerson  We ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous parts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all things; which is the mean of many extremes. It is the most enduring quality, and the most ascending quality.

Where the dynamics of the complex systems are high dimensional, non-linear, partially observable and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe and model the aspects of reality at the appropriate level of abstraction, and it&amp;rsquo;s even harder to predict and anticipate the emergence and its outcome because of inherent uncertainty of the system. And yet, here we are, in the midst of information explosion and technological advancement.</description>

      <description>Skeleton Cover Letter Hi there,
I&amp;rsquo;m a Python/C/C++/whatever-is-needed engineer, and I think that COMPANY_NAME and I would go together like an optimization machine.
Here is list of interesting things (IMO) I have done
 I designed and implemented a complete chess engine from scratch with AI. (You can download here and play with it.) I designed and implemented a website called Abstract Concept. I taught japanese language in lectures to 16-50 years old.</description>
